A very simple p2p console messaging app.
Mainly did this out of interest and to study networks and cryptography.

Plans for the future development are:
  Test connections outside of the local network
  Add 2 key encryption with PGP

Example use:
Run the executable twice. Enter usernames. 
1 should be the server at port 8080
2 should be the client connecting to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) at port 8080
